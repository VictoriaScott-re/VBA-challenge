Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

The ticker symbol
Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The total stock volume of the stock. 

Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

Xpert Learning Assistant - this helped me to get started with an outline.

ChatGPT - This was able to point out mistakes I made and debug.

Classmate Nes pointed out that I was writing the ticker after I move to the next ticker so I had to increment my variable ticker after I printed my first one.

Classmate Stephanie Souza helped me to make sure my numbers matched. We were missing the reset to zero after the end of the cycle. She also helped me with formatting the cells in VBA.
